# Overview

This project is a web application developed to enhance my skills as a software engineer and explore various modern web technologies. The web app showcases my graphic design projects, including PDFs and other digital artworks. The primary goal is to create an engaging and interactive portfolio that dynamically displays design projects.

The web app uses Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. The app fetches design data from a Prisma-powered database and displays it in a user-friendly gallery format.

To start a test server on your computer:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the first page of the app.

This project serves as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of full-stack development, focusing on integrating backend services with a modern frontend framework.
